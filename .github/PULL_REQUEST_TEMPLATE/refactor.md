# Refactor Pull Request

## Summary
- One‑sentence description of the refactor.

## Motivation & Goals
- Why this refactor now (readability, modularity, duplication removal, type‑safety, maintainability, perf groundwork).

## Non‑functional Change Statement
- [ ] No intended behavior changes
- If any behavior change is intentional, list precisely and justify.

## Scope
- What’s included.
- Explicitly out of scope / follow‑ups.

## Approach
- Key design changes (APIs, boundaries, files moved/renamed).
- Alternatives considered.

## Test Plan
- [ ] Characterization tests added if behavior risk (capture current behavior)
- [ ] Existing tests kept green throughout refactor
- [ ] Typecheck, lint, unit tests, build all pass locally
- [ ] Representative manual checks (if UI/CLI)

## Risks & Rollback
- Risks: regressions from code movement/renames, edge‑case handling
- Rollback: how to revert + validation steps

## Metrics (optional)
- Build size, bundle size, or perf baselines if relevant.

## Screenshots / Recordings (if UI)
- Before/After captures.

## Checklist
- [ ] Conventional Commits (, ≤72‑char subject, no emojis)
- [ ] No functional changes (or intentional changes documented above)
- [ ] PR size within budget (~100–250 LOC, ≤8 files); split/stack if >~300 non‑mechanical
- [ ] Mechanical changes isolated (formatting/renames/codegen/lockfiles)
- [ ] Lint, typecheck, tests, build all pass
- [ ] Docs updated if public API/structure changed
- [ ] Opened as Draft; mark Ready after checks pass
- [ ] Branch ; never commit to 
- [ ]  reviewed; stack via Graphite
- [ ] Approval obtained if any irreversible change
