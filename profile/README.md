# Outfitter 🎒

> Supplying explorers of all types. We build practical tools for humans & agents alike.

> [!WARNING]
> Active R&D, lots of edges. Most work here is by [@galligan](https://github.com/galligan) with help from a bunch of handy robots. Expect rapid iteration and occasional breaking changes.

## What is Outfitter?

Purpose-built, composable utilities that make building products faster, and (hopefully) easier (without heavy platforms or lock‑in). Think “expedition gear” for modern agentic development.

## What’s here (and coming online)

* **[Waymark](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/waymark)** — lightweight `:::` code wayfinding so humans and agents can navigate the same breadcrumbs.
* **[Rulesets](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/rulesets)** — write rules once; compile to multiple agent formats (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.).
* **[Carabiner](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/carabiner)** — type‑safe hooks for Claude Code that intercept/guard agent actions (shell, git, fs, http).
* **[Blz](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/blz)** — (really) fast, local‑first search over `llms.txt` sources so agents don't have crawl the web anymore.
* **[Basecamp](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/monorepo) (monorepo)** — shared configs, types, and scripts to keep projects boring and consistent.
* **Radio** *(early)* — a thin coordination layer that ingests signals and points the way for agents…think agentic PMs.

## Philosophy

* **Composable, not monolithic** — use one, some, or all.
* **Typed and explicit** — clarity beats cleverness.
* **Human‑friendly, agent‑ready** — shared language, simple surfaces.
* **Local‑first when pragmatic** — speed and ownership over ceremony.
* **No platform lock‑in** — small tools, clear escape hatches.
