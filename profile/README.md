## About ~~us~~ me

🤖 We (mostly just @mg and a team of agents) make software and other stuff

## Why "maybe good?"

1. 👉🏻 My initials are MG
2. 🤞🏻 I generally try to make stuff that's useful, and hopefully may be good
3. 🤘🏻 The things I make are helpful/useful/fun for me, and while not guaranteed, they may be good for you too…
